# micro-apps-pay

This is a micro service webapp I wrote using [Pay On](https://www.aciworldwide.com/) API (https://docs.oppwa.com/). Unfortunately I do not have a hosting service to put it live on line.

This is written in nodejs and reactjs. To run (gulp serve), make sure you have npm installed and npm packages installed. 

getStatus.js is for internal testing use only. 
Customers/ordinary users can see the payment status in the last page of the app.
